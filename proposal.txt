Succulent Calender
Description: A website with a calender to keep track of succulents, (i.e. watering dates or other info). There will be three web pages - a homepage where you can see a list of your current plants, a calender page where you can note down watering dates for each plant and the calender will autofill subsequent watering dates based on the plant's species, and a directory of all plants supported by the website that users can chose new plants from to add to their calender.
